# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System using NLP and Streamlit
Overview
This is a Movie Recommendation System built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Streamlit. The system suggests movies based on the user's input movie title by utilizing content-based filtering.

Trained on the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, this app fetches similar movie recommendations based on movie genres, keywords, and overviews.

Clean User Interface: Built using Streamlit, offering a simple and intuitive user experience.

Poster Display: Movie posters are shown for each recommendation.

Real-Time Recommendations: Dynamically fetches results based on user input.

Tech Stack
