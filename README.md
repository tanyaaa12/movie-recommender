# ðŸŽ¬ **Movie Recommendation System** using NLP and Streamlit

## Overview
This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Streamlit. The system suggests movies based on the user's input movie title by utilizing content-based filtering.

Trained on the **TMDB (The Movie Database)** dataset, this app fetches similar movie recommendations based on movie genres, keywords, and overviews.

## Features
- **Similar Movie Recommendations**: Get a list of movies similar to the selected movie.
- **Clean User Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, offering a simple and intuitive user experience.
- **Poster Display**: Movie posters are shown for each recommendation.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Dynamically fetches results based on user input.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: 
  - Python
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - Sklearn (for cosine similarity and vectorization)
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for text processing)
- **Frontend**: 
  - Streamlit (for building the app UI)
- **Others**: 
  - Requests (for fetching movie posters)
  - Google Drive (for storing and retrieving large pre-trained files)

## How it Works
1. **User Input**: Select a movie title from the dropdown list.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: Based on the selected movie, the system computes cosine similarity and fetches the top 10 similar movies.
3. **UI Display**: The recommendations are shown with their posters and titles for easy browsing.

## Deployment
The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. You can access it [here](https://movie-recommender-uktw9x6xcowwdnqdjbo2ls.streamlit.app/).

## Future Improvements
- **User Feedback**: Allow users to rate recommendations.
- **Hybrid Model**: Incorporate collaborative filtering to improve recommendations.
- **Mobile Version**: Optimize the app for mobile devices.
